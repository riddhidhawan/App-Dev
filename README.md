## What is App Development?
When it comes to technology, there are plenty of career paths one can take. One area that has seen an incredible rise in popularity is that of app development. There are literally millions of apps available today, from music apps to banking apps. that help people perform specific tasks.

Application development is the process of creating a computer program or a set of programs to perform the different tasks that a business requires. From calculating monthly expenses to scheduling sales reports, applications help businesses automate processes and increase efficiency. Every app-building process follows the same steps: gathering requirements, designing prototypes, testing, implementation, and integration.

An app developer is a computer software engineer whose primary responsibilities include creating, testing and programming apps for computers, mobile phones, and tablets. These developers typically work in teams, and think of ideas and concepts either for the general public, or for a specific customer need.
